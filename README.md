Emoji Game: Test Your Memory & Reflexes! 🎮😃
Welcome to the Emoji Game, a fun and exciting challenge that tests your memory and speed! 🚀

🕹️ How to Play:

7 emojis will randomly appear on the screen at different times.
Your goal is to tap on each emoji only once!
If you accidentally touch an emoji you've already tapped before, game over! ❌
The game gets more challenging as more emojis appear—stay focused and think fast!
🎯 Objective:
Tap all the emojis without repeating any and see how long you can last!
